                <p>I am currently a senior at the University of St. Thomas (grad. date Dec. 2021) majoring in
                    computer science. I am also a veteran paratrooper of the 82nd Airborne Divison. I have a passion to create
                    operational, efficient, and secure software. I have accepted a position at Travelers in their Technlogy Leadership Development Program starting in
                    January. What interests me the most in Computer Science is Cloud development and applications, especially when it is used in conjunction with ML/AI applications.
